    /*
    Given three strings S, S1, and S2 consisting of N, M, and K characters respectively,
    the task is to modify the string S by replacing all the substrings S1 with the string S2
    in the string S.

    Examples:
    Input: S = “abababa”, S1 = “aba”, S2 = “a”
    Output: aba
    Explanation:
    Change the substrings S[0, 2] and S[4, 6](= S1) to the string S2(= “a”) modifies
    the string S to “aba”. Therefore, print “aba”.


    Input: S = “geeksforgeeks”, S1 = “eek”, S2 = “ok”
    Output: goksforgoks
